Features](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-adds-shopping-to-chatgpt/)\n\nChatGPT now features integrated shopping capabilities, offering personalized product recommendations directly within the chat interface. Available to all users, it curates suggestions using preferences and data from review sources like Reddit and editorial content. Purchases are completed via redirection to the seller's site. Notably, results are organic and ad-free, contrasting with sponsored listings common in traditional search engines, and leveraging conversational context over simple keywords.\n\n**What this means:**¬†This move blends conversational AI with e-commerce, aiming to create a more integrated and trusted shopping advisory experience, potentially disrupting conventional online retail and search engine shopping models. \\[[Listen](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/ai-unraveled-latest-ai-news-trends-chatgpt-gemini-gen/id1684415169)\\] \\[[2025/04/30](https://djamgatech.web.app/)\\]\n\n# üõ∞Ô∏è¬†[Amazon Deploys First Kuiper Internet Satellites](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/amazon-launches-first-kuiper-internet-satellites-taking-starlink-2025-04-28/)\n\nAmazon successfully deployed its first 27 Kuiper internet satellites, initiating its ambitious plan to establish a global broadband network rivaling SpaceX's Starlink. Positioned 280 miles above Earth, the satellites are operational and communicating with ground stations. Amazon anticipates offering high-speed, low-latency internet services to initial customers later this year.\n\n**What this means:**¬†Amazon's entry into the satellite internet arena intensifies competition, promising broader global broadband access and potentially driving innovation in satellite technology and services (which often rely on AI for optimization). \\[[Listen](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/ai-unraveled-latest-ai-news-trends-chatgpt-gemini-gen/id1684415169)\\] \\[[2025/04/30](https://djamgatech.web.app/)\\]\n\n# üèõÔ∏è¬†[Amazon Denies Plan to Display Tariff Costs After White House Criticism](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/white-house-amazon-tariff-price-announcement-is-hostile-2025-04-29/)\n\nFollowing White House criticism, Amazon denied reports of a plan to explicitly display the cost impact of new US tariffs on Chinese goods during checkout.

        "selftext": "Introduction\n------------\n\nDid you know many **AI projects** never make it past the test stage? Big problem, no? This happens because setting up the right **cloud AI infrastructure** is tough. Microsoft wants to fix this. This article explains Microsoft's plan to help businesses use **artificial intelligence** in the **cloud**. I'll talk about the **Azure AI platform**, how Microsoft is different from others, and what the future holds. You will know how Microsoft uses the **cloud** to make **AI** easier for everyone.\n\nI. Understanding the Growing Demand for Cloud AI Infrastructure\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### A. The Move to Cloud-Based AI Solutions\n\nBefore, people used to keep **AI** stuff on computers in their own offices. This cost more money. It was also difficult to make things bigger when needed. **Cloud** is cheaper. **Cloud** lets you make things bigger fast. Everyone can use it from anywhere. Many **companies** now use the **cloud** for **AI** because it is easy and saves money.\n\n### B. Cloud AI Market Numbers\n\nThe **cloud AI market** is getting very big. Experts say it will grow a lot in the next few years. For example, one report says the **cloud AI market** will grow by 30% each year. Microsoft has a part of this market, but other **companies** like Amazon and Google have bigger parts. Microsoft wants to get a bigger piece of the **cloud AI** pie.\n\n### C. How Industries Use Cloud AI\n\nMany **industries** now use **cloud AI**. For example, hospitals use **AI** to give people special medicine. Banks use **AI** to find bad guys trying to steal money. Stores use **AI** to guess what people will buy. These **industries** use **cloud AI** because it helps them do things better and faster. **Personalized medicine**, **fraud detection**, and **predictive maintenance** are a few examples.\n\nII. Microsoft's Comprehensive Cloud AI Infrastructure: Azure AI Platform\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### A. What is Azure AI?\n\n**Azure AI** is like a toolbox. It has many tools to help you build **AI** things. It has services, tools, and computers. All these things work together to make **AI** easy to use. This toolbox is called the **Azure AI platform**.\n\n### B. Key Parts of the Azure AI Platform\n\n#### 1. AI Infrastructure\n\n**AI** needs powerful computers. **Azure AI** has special computers called **GPUs** and **AI accelerators**. These computers help **AI** programs run fast. For example, Microsoft uses NVIDIA GPUs in their cloud. They also make their own **AI chips** to make things even faster.\n\n#### 2. AI Services\n\n**Azure AI** has many services. **Cognitive Services** help computers see, hear, and talk like people. **Machine Learning** helps computers learn from data. **Bot Service** helps you make computer programs that talk to people. Each service does something different to help you build **AI** programs. **Vision**, **speech**, and **language** tools are included.\n\n#### 3. AI Tools and Frameworks\n\n**Azure AI** works with many popular **AI** tools. It supports **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, and **ONNX**. These are like different languages for **AI**. It also has **Azure Machine Learning Studio**. This tool helps you build **AI** programs without writing code.\n\nIII. Competitive Advantages of Microsoft's Cloud AI Strategy\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### A.

Big problem, no? This happens because setting up the right &lt;strong&gt;cloud AI infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt; is tough. Microsoft wants to fix this. This article explains Microsoft&amp;#39;s plan to help businesses use &lt;strong&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;cloud&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;#39;ll talk about the &lt;strong&gt;Azure AI platform&lt;/strong&gt;, how Microsoft is different from others, and what the future holds. You will know how Microsoft uses the &lt;strong&gt;cloud&lt;/strong&gt; to make &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; easier for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;I. Understanding the Growing Demand for Cloud AI Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;A. The Move to Cloud-Based AI Solutions&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before, people used to keep &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; stuff on computers in their own offices. This cost more money. It was also difficult to make things bigger when needed. &lt;strong&gt;Cloud&lt;/strong&gt; is cheaper. &lt;strong&gt;Cloud&lt;/strong&gt; lets you make things bigger fast. Everyone can use it from anywhere. Many &lt;strong&gt;companies&lt;/strong&gt; now use the &lt;strong&gt;cloud&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; because it is easy and saves money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;B. Cloud AI Market Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;cloud AI market&lt;/strong&gt; is getting very big. Experts say it will grow a lot in the next few years. For example, one report says the &lt;strong&gt;cloud AI market&lt;/strong&gt; will grow by 30% each year. Microsoft has a part of this market, but other &lt;strong&gt;companies&lt;/strong&gt; like Amazon and Google have bigger parts. Microsoft wants to get a bigger piece of the &lt;strong&gt;cloud AI&lt;/strong&gt; pie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;C. How Industries Use Cloud AI&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;strong&gt;industries&lt;/strong&gt; now use &lt;strong&gt;cloud AI&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, hospitals use &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; to give people special medicine. Banks use &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; to find bad guys trying to steal money. Stores use &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; to guess what people will buy. These &lt;strong&gt;industries&lt;/strong&gt; use &lt;strong&gt;cloud AI&lt;/strong&gt; because it helps them do things better and faster. &lt;strong&gt;Personalized medicine&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;fraud detection&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;predictive maintenance&lt;/strong&gt; are a few examples.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;II. Microsoft&amp;#39;s Comprehensive Cloud AI Infrastructure: Azure AI Platform&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;A. What is Azure AI?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure AI&lt;/strong&gt; is like a toolbox. It has many tools to help you build &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; things. It has services, tools, and computers. All these things work together to make &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; easy to use. This toolbox is called the &lt;strong&gt;Azure AI platform&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;B. Key Parts of the Azure AI Platform&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;1. AI Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; needs powerful computers. &lt;strong&gt;Azure AI&lt;/strong&gt; has special computers called &lt;strong&gt;GPUs&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;AI accelerators&lt;/strong&gt;. These computers help &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; programs run fast. For example, Microsoft uses NVIDIA GPUs in their cloud. They also make their own &lt;strong&gt;AI chips&lt;/strong&gt; to make things even faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;2. AI Services&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure AI&lt;/strong&gt; has many services. &lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Services&lt;/strong&gt; help computers see, hear, and talk like people. &lt;strong&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/strong&gt; helps computers learn from data. &lt;strong&gt;Bot Service&lt;/strong&gt; helps you make computer programs that talk to people. Each service does something different to help you build &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; programs. &lt;strong&gt;Vision&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;speech&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;language&lt;/strong&gt; tools are included.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;3. AI Tools and Frameworks&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure AI&lt;/strong&gt; works with many popular &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; tools. It supports &lt;strong&gt;TensorFlow&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;PyTorch&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;ONNX&lt;/strong&gt;. These are like different languages for &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt;. It also has &lt;strong&gt;Azure Machine Learning Studio&lt;/strong&gt;. This tool helps you build &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; programs without writing code.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;III. Competitive Advantages of Microsoft&amp;#39;s Cloud AI Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;A. Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Abilities&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Microsoft knows some &lt;strong&gt;companies&lt;/strong&gt; want to keep some things in their own offices.

Microsoft wants you to trust that your data is safe when you use &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Data privacy&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;security&lt;/strong&gt; are very important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;IV. Microsoft&amp;#39;s AI-Specific Hardware Investments &amp;amp; Innovation&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;A.

I‚Äôm working on an idea for an AI-powered code review assistant that‚Äôs different from what‚Äôs currently out there (CodeRabbit, Sourcery, Greptile, Amazon CodeGuru, etc.). \n\nI‚Äôve analyzed feedback from dev communities and noticed recurring frustrations:\n\n1. Too much noise/trivial comments from current AI reviewers.\n2. Lack of codebase-wide context (many only look at diffs).\n3. Difficult or no customization options.\n4. Surprise charges or complicated pricing models.\n5. Limited language support or awkward integrations.\n\nHere‚Äôs what my new tool would provide to directly address these problems:\n\n1. Full Project Awareness: Analyzes your whole codebase to catch cross-file bugs.\n2. Smart Filtering &amp; Learning: Learns from your PR interactions, reducing noisy or irrelevant suggestions over time.\n3. Interactive Review: Can ask clarifying questions like a human reviewer (‚ÄúDid you consider using X pattern here?‚Äù).\n4. Easy Customization: Intuitive UI, no manual JSON/YAML setup required.\n5. Fair Pricing: Flat monthly pricing, generous free-tier for solo devs, no hidden fees.\n6. Broad Language Support &amp; Integrations: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and IDE plugins.\n\nI‚Äôd appreciate feedback:\n\n1. Does this solve a real problem you face?\n2. Would you (personally or professionally) adopt something like this?\n3. Any crucial feature I missed or that you‚Äôd absolutely need?\n4. Pricing preferences ‚Äì monthly subscription or usage-based?\n\nYour insights would be super helpful to refine and validate this further! Thanks a ton in advance üôè",

        "selftext": "This summary is the output of a workflow run on [PocketQuant](https://pocket-quant.com?utm=reddit-auto).\n\n## Overview\nMeta reported a strong Q1 2025, emphasizing robust user growth, significant advances in AI infrastructure and products, and continued margin expansion. Key drivers and risks centered around Meta‚Äôs ongoing AI investments, regulatory headwinds in Europe, macroeconomic uncertainty including potential tariff/trade disruptions, and spending/ROI on AI infrastructure. Product commentary and guidance were closely watched, particularly on Meta AI, Reality Labs, and business messaging.\n\n---\n\n## Highlights Potentially Driving Stock Price\n- **Q1 Revenue:** $42.3B (+16% YoY), led by continued ad strength and business messaging growth.\n- **Operating Income:** $17.6B; **Operating Margin:** 41%.\n- **AI Infrastructure:** CapEx for FY25 raised to $64-72B (up from prior $60-65B), reflecting accelerated data center/infrastructure buildup and higher hardware costs due to supply chain/geopolitical factors.\n- **AI Integration:** Notable traction on Meta AI (nearly 1B monthly actives), generative ads (improved conversion rates), and AI glasses (Ray-Ban Meta tripled sales YoY).\n- **Regulatory/EU Headwind:** European DMA ruling could result in significant revenue/user experience impact as early as Q3 2025.\n- **Business Messaging:** WhatsApp (3B+ monthly actives) and incremental revenue from business messaging in lower labor-cost geographies.\n- **Guidance:** Q2 revenue of $42.5-45.5B; full-year expenses lowered, CapEx raised due to AI.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Q&amp;A ‚Äî Key Investor Questions &amp; Management Responses\n\n### AI/LLM/Meta AI\n&gt; **Q (Morgan Stanley):** \"Mark, can you talk through Llama advancements, Behemoth, and Meta AI traction?\"\n\n**A (Mark Zuckerberg):** \"We're focused on building Llama to fit our infra and use cases‚Äîlow latency for voice, long context windows for personalization. The 'Behemoth' model is distilled so we can serve low-latency, efficient production models. All these investments power downstream AI opportunities.\"\n\n&gt; **Q (Morgan Stanley):** \"Meta AI user traction?\"\n\n**A (Susan Li):** \"Top use case is info gathering, followed by social interaction, writing assistance. WhatsApp is the biggest driver, with Facebook as #2 (via feed deep dives). Standalone Meta AI app launch is promising.\"\n\n&gt; **Q (Goldman Sachs):** \"Why a standalone Meta AI app? Will you compete with other consumer AI apps?\"\n\n**A (Zuckerberg):** \"US market needs such an app since WhatsApp isn't the dominant messenger here. It gives users faster access and more robust AI features.\"\n\n### CapEx/AI Infrastructure\n&gt; **Q (BofA):** \"CapEx close to hyperscaler levels: help frame the infrastructure ecosystem and ROI ‚Äî even without external AI revenue?\"\n\n**A (Susan Li):** \"CapEx is both core biz and generative AI-focused. Demand for compute is outpacing capacity; we're building flexibly for future needs.\"\n\n&gt; **Q (JPM):** \"CapEx bump drivers? Infrastructure partnership?\"\n\n**A (Susan Li):** \"Increase comes from both more data center and hardware costs (supplier/trade uncertainty). Llama partners help with hosting, but Meta funds training infra directly.\"\n\n### Macro/Tariffs/Commerce Trends\n&gt; **Q (BofA &amp; Evercore ISI):** \"Supply issues in e-commerce, softness in China-related verticals/auto/gaming?\"\n\n**A (Susan Li):** \"Q2 guide reflects macro/segment uncertainty. There's been reduced US ad spend from Asia-based exporters ahead of the de minimis exemption repeal; some spend redirected but overall is down. Gaming/Politics also weak YoY, but other verticals healthy.\"\n\n### Business Messaging/AI Agents\n&gt; **Q (Wells Fargo):** \"Timing for AI-driven WhatsApp for business adoption in high labor-cost regions? Incremental to SME ad spend?\"\n\n**A (Susan Li):** \"Testing business AIs in US + globally, initially with SMEs‚ÄîAI to cover full customer funnel (lead-gen to service). Feedback is positive‚ÄîAI agents are saving businesses time and will be able to unify customer experience across apps.\"\n\n### Reality Labs\n&gt; **Q (Evercore ISI):** \"Reality Labs losses ~$4B/quarter; path to improvement?\"\n\n**A (Susan Li &amp; Zuckerberg):** \"No timeline, but as AI glasses/other products scale (think 10M+ units for leading 3rd gen consumer electronics), losses should moderate as distribution/monetization increase.\"\n\n### Competitive Positioning (vs Other AIs)\n&gt; **Q (Truist Securities):** \"Is Meta AI a winner-take-most market (like search)? Top differentiators?\"\n\n**A (Zuckerberg):** \"There'll be multiple agents‚Äîeach for different user needs, but personalization (using long context/memory across apps) and multimodal capabilities (voice, images, video) are Meta‚Äôs edge.\"\n\n### Regulatory/Europe DMA\n&gt; **Q (Truist Securities):** \"DMA non-compliance: financial impact?\"\n\n**A (Susan Li):** \"Impacted region is 16% of global ad revenue. Too early for specifics, engaging with EC, but risk of material impact by Q3 2025.\"\n\n### AI Coding/Productivity\n&gt; **Q (Bernstein):** \"How fast will AI coding agents reach mid-level engineer capability?\"\n\n**A (Zuckerberg):** \"Still on track for mid-level engineer productivity within this year, scaling next; expect substantial R&amp;D offloaded to AI by 2H 2025.\"\n\n### Ad System ROI/IDFA\n&gt; **Q (Barclays):** \"How far are you into improving ad system ROI post-IDFA?\"\n\n**A (Susan Li):** \"Past AI/infra investments yielding strong Y/Y conversion growth and higher ad performance; sustained margin and competitive gains in direct response.\"\n\n---\n\n## Facts on Major Meta Products\n- **Meta AI:** Nearly 1B monthly actives, top use cases are information, social, and writing support. Standalone app launched; WhatsApp is primary access point globally, but Facebook gaining as well.\n- **LLMs (Llama 4, Behemoth):** Designed for low latency/voice/personalization. Meta fully funds infra/training, but leverages AWS/Azure for hosting/public cloud access.\n- **Ray-Ban Meta Glasses:** Sales tripled YoY, 4x MAUs vs year ago; real-time translation and more features to drive adoption.\n- **Threads:** Now at 350M+ MAUs, integration of LLMs lifted time spent by 4%.\n- **Meta AI in Ads:** New JEM model produced a 5% Reels ad conversion lift; \"Advantage Plus\" adoption up (30% of advertisers now using AI creative tools).\n- **Reality Labs:** $4.2B loss, but growing hardware unit adoption considered a clear opportunity for future scaling and monetization.\n\n---\n\n## Notable Risks &amp; Opportunities\n- **AI/Infra Investment:** Fast acceleration of CapEx/infra and hiring for AI (majority of new hires are technical roles);\n- **Regulatory:** DMA/EC process remains a headline risk with major (16% of revenue) European geographies exposed.\n- **Profitability:** Margin expansion despite heavy AI investments ‚Äî clear focus on infrastructure efficiency and core business optimization.\n- **Macro/Trade:** Ongoing hardware cost and supply uncertainty (tariffs, trade friction, inflation in infra sourcing).\n- **Product Upside:** Standalone Meta AI, glasses, and business messaging can drive long-term TAM expansion if adoption continues.\n\n---\n\n## Updates Not in the 8-K/Additional Color\n- Standalone Meta AI app launch and details on product vision/US positioning (vs WhatsApp/Apple iMessage).\n- Specific traction and feedback on business AI/agent deployments in WhatsApp/Instagram beta programs.\n- Commentary on JEM generative ads model specifics, and technical details for Llama models (context window, architecture).\n- Insight into hardware cost/CapEx uncertainty due to supplier/country sourcing and global trade environment.\n- Early user behavior around Meta AI (info, social, writing); Threads-specific LLM performance uplift numbers; specifics on internal AI agent/coding progress for productivity gains.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\nMeta's Q1 2025 call reinforced its pivotal year thesis, with AI as the clear central investment and strategic focus for infra, products, and monetization. Management remains bullish on the long-term ROI of current spending despite near-term pressure from regulatory, macro, and supply chain headwinds. Regulatory outcomes (DMA in Europe), business messaging/AI agent adoption speed in developed markets, and continued AI infrastructure scaling are watchpoints for the rest of 2025.\n\n**Fiscal date ending:** 2025-03-31\n\n[Citations: META Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript]",

Will you compete with other consumer AI apps?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A (Zuckerberg):&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;US market needs such an app since WhatsApp isn&amp;#39;t the dominant messenger here. It gives users faster access and more robust AI features.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;CapEx/AI Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q (BofA):&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;CapEx close to hyperscaler levels: help frame the infrastructure ecosystem and ROI ‚Äî even without external AI revenue?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A (Susan Li):&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;CapEx is both core biz and generative AI-focused. Demand for compute is outpacing capacity; we&amp;#39;re building flexibly for future needs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q (JPM):&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;CapEx bump drivers? Infrastructure partnership?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A (Susan Li):&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Increase comes from both more data center and hardware costs (supplier/trade uncertainty). Llama partners help with hosting, but Meta funds training infra directly.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Macro/Tariffs/Commerce Trends&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q (BofA &amp;amp; Evercore ISI):&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Supply issues in e-commerce, softness in China-related verticals/auto/gaming?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A (Susan Li):&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Q2 guide reflects macro/segment uncertainty. There&amp;#39;s been reduced US ad spend from Asia-based exporters ahead of the de minimis exemption repeal; some spend redirected but overall is down. Gaming/Politics also weak YoY, but other verticals healthy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Business Messaging/AI Agents&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q (Wells Fargo):&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Timing for AI-driven WhatsApp for business adoption in high labor-cost regions? Incremental to SME ad spend?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A (Susan Li):&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Testing business AIs in US + globally, initially with SMEs‚ÄîAI to cover full customer funnel (lead-gen to service). Feedback is positive‚ÄîAI agents are saving businesses time and will be able to unify customer experience across apps.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Reality Labs&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q (Evercore ISI):&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Reality Labs losses ~$4B/quarter; path to improvement?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A (Susan Li &amp;amp; Zuckerberg):&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;No timeline, but as AI glasses/other products scale (think 10M+ units for leading 3rd gen consumer electronics), losses should moderate as distribution/monetization increase.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Competitive Positioning (vs Other AIs)&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q (Truist Securities):&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Is Meta AI a winner-take-most market (like search)? Top differentiators?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A (Zuckerberg):&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;ll be multiple agents‚Äîeach for different user needs, but personalization (using long context/memory across apps) and multimodal capabilities (voice, images, video) are Meta‚Äôs edge.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Regulatory/Europe DMA&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q (Truist Securities):&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;DMA non-compliance: financial impact?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A (Susan Li):&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Impacted region is 16% of global ad revenue. Too early for specifics, engaging with EC, but risk of material impact by Q3 2025.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;AI Coding/Productivity&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q (Bernstein):&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;How fast will AI coding agents reach mid-level engineer capability?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A (Zuckerberg):&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Still on track for mid-level engineer productivity within this year, scaling next; expect substantial R&amp;amp;D offloaded to AI by 2H 2025.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Ad System ROI/IDFA&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q (Barclays):&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;How far are you into improving ad system ROI post-IDFA?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A (Susan Li):&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Past AI/infra investments yielding strong Y/Y conversion growth and higher ad performance; sustained margin and competitive gains in direct response.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Facts on Major Meta Products&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta AI:&lt;/strong&gt; Nearly 1B monthly actives, top use cases are information, social, and writing support. Standalone app launched; WhatsApp is primary access point globally, but Facebook gaining as well.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LLMs (Llama 4, Behemoth):&lt;/strong&gt; Designed for low latency/voice/personalization. Meta fully funds infra/training, but leverages AWS/Azure for hosting/public cloud access.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ray-Ban Meta Glasses:&lt;/strong&gt; Sales tripled YoY, 4x MAUs vs year ago; real-time translation and more features to drive adoption.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threads:&lt;/strong&gt; Now at 350M+ MAUs, integration of LLMs lifted time spent by 4%.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta AI in Ads:&lt;/strong&gt; New JEM model produced a 5% Reels ad conversion lift; &amp;quot;Advantage Plus&amp;quot; adoption up (30% of advertisers now using AI creative tools).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reality Labs:&lt;/strong&gt; $4.2B loss, but growing hardware unit adoption considered a clear opportunity for future scaling and monetization.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Notable Risks &amp;amp; Opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI/Infra Investment:&lt;/strong&gt; Fast acceleration of CapEx/infra and hiring for AI (majority of new hires are technical roles);&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory:&lt;/strong&gt; DMA/EC process remains a headline risk with major (16% of revenue) European geographies exposed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profitability:&lt;/strong&gt; Margin expansion despite heavy AI investments ‚Äî clear focus on infrastructure efficiency and core business optimization.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macro/Trade:&lt;/strong&gt; Ongoing hardware cost and supply uncertainty (tariffs, trade friction, inflation in infra sourcing).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Upside:&lt;/strong&gt; Standalone Meta AI, glasses, and business messaging can drive long-term TAM expansion if adoption continues.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Updates Not in the 8-K/Additional Color&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Standalone Meta AI app launch and details on product vision/US positioning (vs WhatsApp/Apple iMessage).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Specific traction and feedback on business AI/agent deployments in WhatsApp/Instagram beta programs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Commentary on JEM generative ads model specifics, and technical details for Llama models (context window, architecture).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Insight into hardware cost/CapEx uncertainty due to supplier/country sourcing and global trade environment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Early user behavior around Meta AI (info, social, writing); Threads-specific LLM performance uplift numbers; specifics on internal AI agent/coding progress for productivity gains.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meta&amp;#39;s Q1 2025 call reinforced its pivotal year thesis, with AI as the clear central investment and strategic focus for infra, products, and monetization. Management remains bullish on the long-term ROI of current spending despite near-term pressure from regulatory, macro, and supply chain headwinds. Regulatory outcomes (DMA in Europe), business messaging/AI agent adoption speed in developed markets, and continued AI infrastructure scaling are watchpoints for the rest of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiscal date ending:&lt;/strong&gt; 2025-03-31&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[Citations: META Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

        "selftext": "  \nFound this nice tutorial for vibecoders in cursor.. below is summary i generated using Notebook LM.\n\nLink of youtube video in comments.\n\nThis video tutorial demonstrates how to build and deploy a fully functional web application, an **Emoji maker**, using the **Cursor AI code editor** with minimal prior programming knowledge. The entire process, from initial setup to online deployment, is showcased.  \n\n\nThe tutorial begins by setting up the project with popular web development tools like **Next.js** (a React framework), **Shadcn UI** (a UI component library), and **Tailwind CSS** (a styling library). The presenter explains the purpose of these technologies and emphasizes the importance of working within the specific project folder in Cursor.\n\nA key aspect highlighted is the use of **detailed requirement documents** instead of relying solely on direct prompts to Cursor. These documents outline the project overview, specific feature requirements (including the libraries to be used like Lucid icons, Supabase for the backend, and Clerk for authentication), relevant API documentation (for the Replicate AI model that generates emojis), and the current file structure. This structured approach helps Cursor understand the project's needs more effectively.\n\nThe **front-end development** involves instructing Cursor to build UI components like an `EmojiGenerator` (with a prompt form) and an `EmojiGrid` (to display generated emojis) based on the requirements and even a Figma mockup. Features like real-time updates, download, and like buttons are added iteratively through prompting Cursor. The use of **Zustand** for state management and the importance of the `use client` directive in Next.js are also explained. Debugging is shown as an integral part of the process, with error messages being fed back to Cursor for solutions.\n\nFor the **back-end**, **Supabase** is used as a comprehensive solution providing a PostgreSQL database, storage, and authentication. The setup involves creating tables (like `profiles` for user information and `emojis` to store generated emojis) and a storage bucket (`emojis`) via SQL and the Supabase UI.\n\n**User authentication** is implemented using **Clerk**, which simplifies the process of adding sign-up and sign-in functionality. This involves installing the Clerk library, adding credentials, and creating middleware for route protection.\n\nConnecting the front-end and back-end is achieved through **API routes** in Next.js. These routes handle tasks like calling the Replicate AI model to generate emojis, uploading them to Supabase storage, updating the database, fetching emojis for display, and managing likes. The tutorial also covers how to handle image URLs from Supabase storage and implement the like functionality with a separate `emoji_likes` table and a Supabase database function to prevent duplicate likes.\n\nThe application is then **deployed online using Vercel**, a platform optimized for Next.js apps. This involves linking a GitHub repository to Vercel and configuring the project settings and environment variables. The video also demonstrates how to debug deployment errors by analyzing Vercel logs and using Cursor to identify and fix issues, often related to missing dependencies or type errors.\n\nThroughout the tutorial, the presenter emphasises the **iterative nature of development with Cursor**, constantly using the chat interface to debug, ask for explanations, and refine the generated code. The final application allows users to enter a text prompt, generate an emoji using an AI model, view all generated emojis, like and download them, and requires user authentication.\n\nThe video concludes by highlighting the speed and relative ease with which a production-ready application can be built using Cursor AI, even for someone without extensive programming experience. It encourages viewers to explore further resources and share their own Cursor tips.\n\n  \n‚è±Ô∏è Timestamps  \n[0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAAbrhb3QoM) Intro to Cursor  \n[1:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAAbrhb3QoM&amp;t=79s) P1 - Setup  \n[7:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAAbrhb3QoM&amp;t=422s) P2 - Build Frontend  \n[19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAAbrhb3QoM&amp;t=1179s) P3 - Build Auth  \n[23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAAbrhb3QoM&amp;t=1397s) P4 - Build Backend  \n[39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAAbrhb3QoM&amp;t=2340s) P5 - Deploy",

So you‚Äôll get a complete inside look even before it drops.\n\nFirst stream starts almost 7 hours from now\\*\\*, link to scheduled livestream in first comment\\*\\*.  \nIf you're into consumer apps, AI coding, or just want to watch someone either ship or crash and burn (lol), come hang out!",

I'm really overthinking on how to actually improve in programming and software engineering. \n\nI'm currently building my knowledge through coding projects. Not just any kind of project though, I'm interested in projects that solves actual problems, big or small doesn't matter. Currently working on a book search website using NLP and vector database/search. \n\nI do find myself completely using AI to generate snippets of code for the AI model however so a few questions came up especially as 'vibe coding' is becoming more and more popular. I don't just use the generated code completely but instead copy the parts that are relevant and paste into my code where it's logical. I just don't write any code AT ALL though. Is this normal? Is this how programming is turning out to be in the future? I'm scared that I'll always rely on AI to build stuff. I'm also conflicted because it helped me so much in providing choices of tech and libraries to choose from, making my workflow so much faster, hence why I can't just stop using and writing everything by hand. Should I?\n\nMaybe the core question that I want to ask for anyone that doesn't want to read the whole thing is, as a student who's genuine about learning software engineering, how do I improve in programming and how do I distinguish when I'm producing good programming work versus when I'm falling into that AI coding trap?",

What was supposed to be a productivity booster became a nightmare: **over 20 redundant tool calls** just to fix **two minor TypeScript linter errors**, racking up unexpected costs and endless frustration.\n\nEven more alarming, users reported:\n\n* **$60+ daily charges** without meaningful results.\n* **Worse productivity** compared to earlier Cursor versions.\n* **Support teams ignoring emails** and DMs.\n* **Massive usage spikes** seemingly triggered by silent updates.\n\nComments poured in with a common thread: developers feel **trapped** ‚Äî reliant on AI tools that burn through budgets while delivering half-finished or error-prone outputs.\n\nIs this a Cursor-specific issue? Is it Claude 3.7 MAX being \"not ready\"? Or is it a deeper problem in how AI is integrated into modern coding workflows?\n\n# The Real Problem: Misaligned AI Expectations\n\nHere's the uncomfortable truth:\n\n**AI coding assistants are not developers.**  \nThey are powerful prediction engines that guess at your intent based on the input and context you provide.\n\nWhen your project lacks:\n\n* Clear task definitions,\n* Explicit architecture guidelines,\n* Real contextual grounding from the codebase,\n\n‚Ä¶you are essentially *asking the AI to guess*. And guesses, no matter how intelligent, often lead to:\n\n* Infinite loops,\n* Inefficient tool calls,\n* Misinterpretations,\n* And ultimately, **higher costs and more frustration**.\n\nThe reality many developers are waking up to is simple:\n\n&gt;\n\n# Why AI Loops and Costs Explode\n\nSeveral core reasons explain the problems users faced with tools like Claude MAX:\n\n1. **Lack of Project Scope Understanding** When AI agents don't have a solid grasp of what the project is about, they chase irrelevant solutions, re-read code unnecessarily, and misdiagnose issues.\n2. **Poor Error Handling Strategies** Instead of understanding the broader goal, AIs often fixate on tiny local errors, leading to endless \"lint fix\" loops.\n3. **Context Window Mismanagement** Most LLMs have a limited \"memory\" (context window). Poor structuring of input data can cause them to lose track of the task halfway through and start over repeatedly.\n4. **Lack of User Control** Automation sounds great ‚Äî until the AI decides to spend your credits investigating unnecessary files without your permission.\n\n# How to Avoid Falling Into the AI Trap\n\nIf you want to use AI tools effectively (and affordably), you must **lead the AI** ‚Äî not follow it.\n\nHere‚Äôs how:\n\n# 1. Plan Before You Prompt\n\nBefore even typing a prompt, clearly define:\n\n* What feature you are building,\n* What parts of the codebase it touches,\n* Any architectural constraints or requirements.\n\nThink of it as **prepping a task ticket for a junior developer**. The clearer the briefing, the better the result.\n\n# 2. Create a Clear System Architecture Map\n\nDon‚Äôt rely on the AI to \"figure out\" your app‚Äôs structure.  \nInstead:\n\n* Diagram the major components.\n* List dependencies between services.\n* Highlight critical models, APIs, or modules.\n\nA simple diagram or spec document saves hundreds of tool calls later.\n\n# 3. Give Rich, Relevant Context\n\nWhen prompting:\n\n* Attach or reference only the necessary files.\n* Include relevant API signatures, data models, or interface definitions.\n* Summarize the problem and desired outcome explicitly.\n\nThe AI needs the **right amount of the right information** ‚Äî not a firehose of random files.\n\n# 4. Control Linter and Auto-Fix Settings\n\nEspecially when using \"MAX\" modes:\n\n* **Disable automatic linter fixes** unless necessary.\n* Prefer manual review of AI-suggested code changes.\n\nLetting the AI \"autonomously\" fix things often results in new errors.\n\n# 5. Monitor Requests and Set Usage Limits\n\nIf your platform allows it:\n\n* Set caps on daily tool call spend.\n* Review request logs regularly.\n* Pause or disable agent modes that behave unpredictably.\n\nEarly detection can prevent runaway costs.\n\n# AI Doesn‚Äôt Eliminate Good Engineering Practices ‚Äî It Demands Them\n\nThere‚Äôs a growing myth that AI tools will replace the need for design documents, system architecture, or thorough scoping. The reality is the opposite:\n\n&gt;\n\nGood engineering hygiene ‚Äî thoughtful planning, solid documentation, clear scope definitions ‚Äî is now **more important than ever**.\n\nWithout it, even the best models spiral into chaos, burning your money and your time.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nAI-assisted coding can be a massive force multiplier when used wisely. But it requires a **shift in mindset**:\n\n* Don‚Äôt treat AI like a magic black box.\n* Treat it like a junior engineer who needs clear instructions, plans, and oversight.\n\nThose who adapt their workflows to this new reality will outperform ‚Äî building faster, better, and cheaper. Those who don't will continue to experience frustration, spiraling costs, and broken codebases.\n\nThe future of coding isn‚Äôt \"prompt and pray.\"  \nIt‚Äôs **plan, prompt, and guide**.",

What was supposed to be a productivity booster became a nightmare: &lt;strong&gt;over 20 redundant tool calls&lt;/strong&gt; just to fix &lt;strong&gt;two minor TypeScript linter errors&lt;/strong&gt;, racking up unexpected costs and endless frustration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even more alarming, users reported:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$60+ daily charges&lt;/strong&gt; without meaningful results.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worse productivity&lt;/strong&gt; compared to earlier Cursor versions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support teams ignoring emails&lt;/strong&gt; and DMs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massive usage spikes&lt;/strong&gt; seemingly triggered by silent updates.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Comments poured in with a common thread: developers feel &lt;strong&gt;trapped&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî reliant on AI tools that burn through budgets while delivering half-finished or error-prone outputs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this a Cursor-specific issue?
